# Design: FedNow message signing in fednow-core

*Status: research done, profile confirmation pending · July 2026*

Every message exchanged with the FedNow Service must be cryptographically signed,
and the service validates both the signature and the binding between the sending
entity and the key ([Technical Overview and Planning Guide](https://explore.fednow.org/resources/technical-overview-guide.pdf),
"Message Signing"). This document records what is publicly confirmed about the
signing scheme, what is not, and how we sequence the work so `fednow-core` makes
progress without betting on unconfirmed details.

## Confirmed by public Federal Reserve documentation

1. **All messages are signed** — both participant-to-service and service-to-participant.
2. **Asymmetric key pairs, participant-generated.** Participants create the pairs
   with "specifications defined by the FedNow Service" using standard tooling
   (OpenSSL, Java, any KMS). This is a registered-key model, not a Fed-issued
   certificate chain: first-time public-key registration happens through the FedNow
   interface, later rotations via key-exchange messages over MQ (the
   `FedNowKeyExchange` message set exists for this).
3. **Private-key confidentiality is an Operating Circular 8 obligation.**
4. **Every FedNow business message carries a Business Application Header**
   (head.001.001.02). The BAH schema's `Sgntr` element (`SignatureEnvelope`,
   a lax `xs:any`) is where ISO 20022 signatures travel by construction.
5. mTLS on the transport and the message signature are **independent layers**;
   one does not replace the other.

## Not yet confirmed: the exact signature profile

The normative profile (algorithms, what exactly is digested, envelope shape) lives
in the **FedNow Service Technical Specifications** on SWIFT MyStandards — free
account, but registration-gated, and its content must not be pasted into this repo
without checking its redistribution terms.

Two candidate shapes exist in the wild:

**(a) ISO/SWIFT-style XMLDSig** — `ds:Signature` inside `AppHdr/Sgntr`;
exclusive C14N; `rsa-sha256`; SHA-256 digests; three references (the `KeyInfo` by
Id, the `AppHdr` itself with the enveloped-signature transform, and the `Document`
as a URI-less reference). This is the profile used by CBPR+/SWIFT tooling and
Mastercard's open-source ISO 20022 signer, and it is what the `SignatureEnvelope`
element was designed to carry. *Evidence: strong for the ISO ecosystem in general;
indirect for FedNow specifically.*

**(b) Detached JWS (RFC 7515/7797)** — RS256, `b64=false`, key id in the protected
header. Community projects (e.g. `open-fednow`) implement this, but over an
HTTP/JSON reinterpretation of FedNow, not the ISO 20022 XML-over-MQ channel — so
this is weak evidence for the wire format. *A JWS-in-`Sgntr` variant would still be
possible; only the spec settles it.*

**Invariants that hold under either profile** (safe to build against now):
RSA ≥ 2048 with SHA-256; the signature is detached and travels with the BAH; the
signer is identified by a key id known to the service; signing must operate on the
exact wire bytes (or a defined canonicalization of them) — never on re-serialized
models.

## Sequencing decision

1. **Now — BAH support (not blocked).** Model + parse + validate head.001.001.02
   in `fednow-core`: `Fr`/`To` (routing numbers), `BizMsgIdr`, `MsgDefIdr`,
   `CreDt`, and `Sgntr` preserved as raw XML for round-tripping. Every later piece
   (simulator, gateway) needs the BAH regardless of the signing profile.
2. **Now — action item (Joca):** create a free MyStandards account
   ([step-by-step guide](https://explore.fednow.org/resources/technical-overview-guide.pdf)
   references it; start at frbservices.org → FedNow ISO 20022 Readiness Portal) and
   read the message-signing section of the Technical Specifications. We need:
   signature envelope shape, canonicalization method, reference/digest structure,
   and how the key id is expressed.
3. **Then — implement the confirmed profile** in a `sign` module:
   - If XMLDSig: implement **exclusive C14N in pure Rust** over the quick-xml event
     stream, scoped to the subset ISO 20022 messages actually use (no DTDs, no
     processing instructions, controlled namespaces). No `libxmlsec1` system
     dependency: it would hurt the multi-platform build and auditability, and a
     scoped C14N is tractable and independently valuable (verification of inbound
     pacs.002 advices needs it too).
   - If JWS: `rsa` + `sha2` + base64url, considerably simpler; C14N is avoided
     entirely.
   - Either way: signing and verification land together, with test vectors checked
     into `core/tests/fixtures/` and — once the simulator exists — round-trip tests
     through `fednow-sim`.

## Non-goals

- No support for Fed-restricted schema content in this repo (licensing).
- No HSM/KMS integration in `fednow-core` itself — the signing API takes a signer
  trait so the gateway can plug HSM-backed keys later without touching the core.
